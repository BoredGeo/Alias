# Earthquake recurrence intervals using the Alias method

Python code for calculating recurrence interval and CV from C14 dates discrete distributions.

The code is based on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method>Alias</a> random sampling scheme, and on the following publication:
>> Biasi, G.P., 2013. Appendix H: maximum likelihood recurrence intervals for California paleoseismic sites. In: US Geol. Surv. Open-file Rept. 2013-1165-H and Calif. Geol. Surv. Special Rept. 228-H.

It includes a jupyter notebook (in the `src` directory) that can be changed according to need.
There are some example .prior files in the `files` directory that were generated with <a href=https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/OxCal.html>OxCal</a>
